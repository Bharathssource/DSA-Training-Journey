# DSA-Training-Journey

This repository documents my Data Structures & Algorithms practice

#Goal 
Solve 150–200 LeetCode problems
- Master core DSA patterns
- Strengthen problem-solving for Data Science / ML roles


Structure
Problems are organized by pattern:

- Arrays
- Hashing
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Recursion
- Stack
- Trees
